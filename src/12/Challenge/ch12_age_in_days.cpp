// Challenge #12: Age in Days Calculator
// Write an application that asks the user's birth date and responds with the user's age in days. 
// If the user claims to be over 120 years old, output a message calling the bluff.

#include <string>
#include <ctime>

// Age in Days, main()
// Summary: This application asks the user's birth date and prints their age in days.
int main(){

    std::cout << "Enter your birth date's month as a number: " << std::flush;
