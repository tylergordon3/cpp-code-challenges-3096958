// Challenge #16: The Birthday Problem
// The birthday problem consists in finding the probability of having at least two people with the same birthday in a group of n people.
// Create an application that simulates the Birthday Problem 1 million times, with the number of people specified by the user.
// Use this application to prove (empirically) that the probability of having at least 2 people with the same birthday is approximately 0.5 for a group of 23 people.

// The Birthday Problem, main()
// Summary: This application simulates the birthday problem a large number of times to reveal the probability of a birthday match in a groupd of a given number of people.
